# NextSeqPostRunDataProcessor

This bash script automates NextSeq Illumina raw data processing by generating ready to upload FASTQ files. The FASTQ files are basecalled using [bcl2fastq Illumina software](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html). The final raw sequences can be uploaded to NML IRIDA server via the [IRIDA Uploader](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida-miseq-uploader).
